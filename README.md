This document provides a mini course in linked lists in JavaScript.

A "linked list" is a data structure that stores a list of values.

Linked lists are like arrays, except they have different performance characteristics.

## <a name="lec1">Lecture 1. Recursion</a>

> "In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion."

A linked list is a "recursive" data structure, and uses "recursive" algorithms.

Recursive simply means self referential.

Rather than elucidating further in English, we'll just dive into the classic example: Fibonacci numbers.

### Fibonacci numbers

Here are the first 9 Fibonacci numbers:
 
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
 
Do you see the pattern?
 
The pattern is this: every Fibonacci number equals the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.

Except for the first two Fibonacci numbers -- the "base cases." By fiat, they are defined to be equal to 1.

Let's write a JS function that computes the *nth* Fibonacci number.

### `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Linked Lists</title>
    <script src="linked-lists.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```

### `linked-lists.js`

```js
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    console.error("Fiboncci numbers are not defined when n <= 0");
  } else if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}

console.log(fibonacci(1));
console.log(fibonacci(2));
console.log(fibonacci(3));
console.log(fibonacci(4));
console.log(fibonacci(5));
console.log(fibonacci(6));
```

View your JS console to verify that `fibonacci(...)` computes the first 6 Fibonacci numbers correctly.

Actually, it would be better to *unit test* the `fibonacci(...)` function, rather than viewing results
on the console.

### Unit Testing

A *unit test* is a piece of code that tests a single unit of code.

Unit testing is awesome and essential.

Here's a unit test for `fibonacci(...)`:

```js
function assert(condition) {
    if (!condition) {
        console.error("Test failed");
    }
}

assert(fibonacci(1) == 1);
assert(fibonacci(2) == 1);
assert(fibonacci(3) == 2);
assert(fibonacci(4) == 3);
assert(fibonacci(5) == 5);
assert(fibonacci(6) == 8);
```

### Unwinding `fibonacci(...)`

Let's trace the code and see what happens when we call `fibonacci(3)`.

- `fibonacci(3)` calls `fibonacci(2)` (*n* - 1)
  - `fibonacci(2)` returns `1`
- `fibonacci(3)` calls `fibonacci(1)` (*n* - 2)
  - `fibonacci(1)` returns `1`
- `fibonacci(3)` sums the result of `fibonacci(2)` and `fibonacci(1)`, and returns 2 (which is 1 + 1)

Ok.  Now let's trace a call to `fibonacci(4)`

- `fibonacci(4)` calls `fibonacci(3)` (*n* - 1)
  - The entire call sequence for `fibonacci(3)` executes (see above) and yields 2
- `fibonacci(4)` calls `fibonacci(2)` (*n* - 2)
  - `fibonacci(2)` returns `1`
- `fibonacci(4)` sums the result of `fibonacci(3)` and `fibonacci(2)`, and returns 3 (which is 2 + 1)

Get it?

### Proof that `fibonacci(n)` terminates for all values of *n*, where *n* >= 1

This section is optional. I present it just in case you enjoy proofs using mathematical induction.

Recall, a proof via [strong induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction)
works as follows:

- Base case: Prove that the theorem holds when *n* == 1
- Inductive step: Prove that if the theorem holds for all *n* (where 1 <= n), then the theorem also holds for *n + 1*

#### Theorem

`fibonacci(n)` terminates for all values of *n*, where *n* >= 1
 
#### Proof

##### Base case

Clearly, the `fibonacci(n)` function terminates when *n* == 1.

##### Inductive step

Assumption 1: Assume `fibonacci(n)` terminates for all 1 <= *n*.

`fibonacci(n + 1)` invokes `fibonacci(n)` and `fibonacci(n - 1)`.

Therefore if `fibonacci(n)` and `fibonacci(n - 1)` terminate, then `fibonacci(n + 1)` terminates.

Case analysis:

- Case A: If *n == 1*, then `fibonacci(n + 1)` clearly terminates
- Case B: If *n > 1*, then `fibonacci(n + 1)` invokes `fibonacci(n)` and `fibonacci(n - 1)`. Since *n > 1*, we know *1 <= n - 1 < n*, and because we are assuming Assumption 1, we know both of those invocations terminate.

Therefore, `fibonacci(n + 1)` clearly terminates in all cases.

QED.

## <a name="lec2">Lecture 2. Node `append(...)`</a>

Study the `Node` class, and type it in to `linked-lists.js`:

```js
class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = undefined;
    }

    // Creates a new node to hold value, and appends the new node to the end
    // of this list.
    //
    // Doesn't return anything.
    append(value) {
        if (this.next == undefined) {
            this.next = new Node(value);
        } else {
            this.next.append(value);
        }
    }
}
```

You use it like this:

```js
var head = new Node("A");
head.append("B");
head.append("C");

assert(head.value == "A");
assert(head.next.value == "B");
assert(head.next.next.value == "C");
assert(head.next.next.next == undefined);
```

Add the `Node` class and usage example into `linked-lists.js`.

### Linked Lists

Node objects link together via the *next* field.

A chain of nodes is called a linked list.

### Visualization

To help make sense of linked lists, we visualize them like so:

## <a name="lec3">Lecture 3. Tips for developing recursive functions</a>

This lecture may sound like gibberish now.

That's fine because we will concretely explore
how these tips apply to many recursive functions throughout this mini course.

### Tip 1. Document the function

Before you begin coding a recursive function, you should document the function.
Specifically, you should precisely document the input to the function, the
return-value for the function, and any side effects.

```js
// Creates a new node to hold value, and appends the new node to the end
// of this list.
//
// Doesn't return anything.
append(value) {
  // ?
}
```

### Tip 2. Base case and recursive case

Every recursive function has at least one "base case" and at least one
"recursive case."

```js
append(value) {

    // base case
    if (this.next == undefined) {
        this.next = new Node(value);
    }

    // recursive case
    else {
        this.next.append(value);
    }
}
```

#### Base case

A *base case* is a case that does not invoke recursion (because there is no longer a need for recursion).

For example, if your recursive function is searching for the last element in the list (as in `append(...)`),
the base case would be the case where the last element has been reached.

Write the base case(s) before you write the recursive case.

If it's not clear how to implement the base case right away, then first document (A) when the base case occurs,
and (B) what should be done in the base case.

#### Recursive case

For a function `f(...)`, the recursive case is the case that invokes `f(...)` recursively.

### Tip 3. Make progress every step of the way

For a recursive function `f(X)`, the recursive case must invoke `f(...)`.

However, it must not invoke `f(X)`, because that would lead to an infinite loop.

Rather, each recursive case must make some progress.

For instance:

- For `f(n)`, the recursive case might call `f(n - 1)`
- For `f(node)`, the recursive case might call `f(node.next)`

In the `append(...)` example below, the recurisve case makes
progress by invoking `append` on `this.next`. 

```js

// Creates a new node to hold value, and appends the new node to the end
// of this list.
//
// Doesn't return anything.
append(value) {

    // base case
    if (this.next == undefined) {
        this.next = new Node(value);
    }

    // recursive case
    else {
        this.next.append(value);
    }
}
```

### Tip 4: Assume correctness

When developing the recursive case **you must assume your function invocation always works exactly as advertised**
(according to the documentation).

It's kind of like the inductive step in an inductive proof.

### Tip 5: Analyze the corner cases

In a linked list the corner cases that tend to arise are:

- (A) `this` == first node AND `this` == last node
- (B) `this` == first node AND `this` != last node
- (C) `this` != first node AND `this` == last node
- (D) `this` != first node AND `this` != last node

Make sure your recursive function works for all corner cases.

#### Example

Let's revist the `append(...)` function:

```js

// Creates a new node to hold value, and appends the new node to the end
// of this list.
//
// Doesn't return anything.
append(value) {

    // base case
    if (this.next == undefined) {
        this.next = new Node(value);
    }

    // recursive case
    else {
        this.next.append(value);
    }
}
```

Analyzing the corner cases for `append(...)`:

##### 1. What if `this` == the first node?

In this case, it could either be the base case or the recursive case,
so we need to make sure `append(...)` works for both of these
cases when `this` == the first node.

Analyze the code:

If `this` == the first node, the base case will work just fine.

If `this` == the first node, the recursive case will work just fine.

##### 2. What if `this` == the last node?

If `this` == the last node, then `this.next` == undefined
(because that's how linked lists signify the end of the list).

Therefore, the base case will execute.

And the base case executes the desired behavior for the `append(...)` function.

##### 3. `this` == first node and `this` == last node

Just like Case 2 (immediately above), the base case executes the desired behavior for the `append(...)` function.

##### 4. `this` != first node and `this` != last node

Since this is not the last node, then `this.next` will be defined, so we only
need to look at the recursive case. The recursive case looks correct in this case.

<br><br><br><br>


## <a name="lec4">Lecture 4. `prepend(...)`</a>

Study the `prepend` method and its tests. Type in `prepend` and its tests into `linked-lists.js`.

```js
class Node {

   ...

   // Creates a new node to hold value, and prepends the new node to this list
   // making the new node the head of the list.
   //
   // Returns a reference to the new head of the list (which is the newly
   // created node).
   prepend(value) {
     var newNode = new Node(value);

     newNode.next = this;

     return newNode;
   }
}

// Test prepend(...)
var head = new Node("A");
head = head.prepend("B");
head = head.prepend("C");

var cNode = head;
var bNode = cNode.next;
var aNode = bNode.next;

assert(aNode.value == "A");
assert(bNode.value == "B");
assert(cNode.value == "C");
assert(aNode.next == undefined);
```

Which is more efficient: `append(...)` or `prepend(...)`?

### Analyzing the performance of `append(...)`

It should be clear that the amount of time it takes 
to execute `append(...)` is proportional to the size of the linked list.

For example, if a linked list has 1 billion nodes, then it will
take a long time to execute `append(...)`.

In computer science terminology and notation, we
say the time performance of `append(...)` is *O(N)*, where *N* is the size of the list.

This is called "Big Oh" notation. In a college-level algorithms course, you would
learn the formal mathematical definition of Big O and Big O analysis. In this
mini course, however, we satisfy ourselves with an informal, rough understanding of Big O.

### Analyzing the performance of `prepend(...)`

If should be clear that the amount of time it takes to 
execute `prepend(...)` is independent of the size of the linked list.

To be more precise, `prepend(...)` takes a constant (i.e. non variable)
amount of time to execute.

Therefore we say the time performance of `prepend(...)` is *O(1)*  (since 1 is a constant).

### Summary

- `append(...)` is *O(N)* -- slow
- `prepend(...)` is *O(1)* -- fast

## <a name="lec5">Lecture 5. `removeFirst(...)`</a>

Study the `removeFirst` method and its tests. Type in `removeFirst` and its tests into `linked-lists.js`.

```js
class Node {
 
    ...

    // Deletes the first node in this list.
    //
    // Returns [v, head] where v is the value that was removed, and head
    // is a reference to the new head (possibly undefined).
    removeFirst() {
        return [this.value, this.next];
    }
}

// Test removeFirst(...)
var head = new Node("A");
head.append("B");
head.append("C");

var [aValue, bNode] = head.removeFirst();
var [bValue, cNode] = bNode.removeFirst();
var [cValue, undef] = cNode.removeFirst();

assert(aValue == "A");
assert(bValue == "B");
assert(cValue == "C");

assert(bNode.value == "B");
assert(cNode.value == "C");
assert(undef == undefined);

```

`removeFirst(...)` is *O(1)*

<br><br><br><br>

## <a name="lec6">Lecture 6. `removeLast(...)`</a>

Let's implement `removeLast(...)`.

```js
class Node {

    // Deletes the last node in this list.
    //
    // Returns [v, newHead] where v is the value that was removed, and
    // newHead is the new head of the list (possibly undefined).
    removeLast() {
        // ?
    }
}
```

Recall the following tips for developing recursive functions:

- Tip 1. Document the function
- Tip 2. Base case and recursive case
- Tip 3. Make progress every step of the way
- Tip 4. Assume correctness
- Tip 5: Analyze the corner cases

Let's build the function by going through each of the tips.

### Use Tip 1: Document function

The function is already documented

### Use Tip 2: Base case and recursive case

Here, the base case is when we've reached the end of the list, i.e. when `this.next == undefined`:

```js
// Deletes the last node in this list.
//
// Returns [v, newHead] where v is the value that was removed, and
// newHead is the new head of the list (possibly undefined).
removeLast() {
    
    // base case: if we've reached the end of the list
    if (this.next == undefined) {
        // modify the list so that this node is no longer the last
    }
    
    // recursive case
    else {
        // ?
    }
}
```

### Use Tip 5: Analyze the corner cases

To implement the base case let's consider the corner cases.
Keep in mind, we want to modify the list so that `this` node is no longer the last.

Recall, in a linked list the corner cases that tend to arise are:

- (A) `this` == first node AND `this` == last node
- (B) `this` == first node AND `this` != last node
- (C) `this` != first node AND `this` == last node
- (D) `this` != first node AND `this` != last node

#### (A) `this` == first node AND `this` == last node

In this case, we simply return `[this.value, undefined]`.

#### (B) `this` == first node AND `this` != last node

This corner case does not apply to the base case, because `this` is guaranteed to be the last node in the base case.

#### (C) `this` != first node AND `this` == last node

In this case, we want to find the previous node, say `prev`, and set `prev.next` to undefined.

Then we want to return `[this.value, head]`, where `head` is the first node of the list.

Now we have two problems:

1. As currently implemented, we don't have a reference to the previous node
2. As currently implemented, we don't have a reference to the head node

We'll solve these problems in a bit.

#### (D) `this` != first node AND `this` != last node

This corner case does not apply to the base case, because `this` is guaranteed to be the last node in the base case.

#### Combining the corner cases into code

```js
// Deletes the last node in this list.
//
// Returns [v, newHead] where v is the value that was removed, and
// newHead is the new head of the list (possibly undefined).
removeLast() {
    
    // base case: if we've reached the end of the list
    if (this.next == undefined) {
    
        // if this is the first node
        if (head == this) {
            return [this.value, undefined];
        }
        
        // if this is not the first node
        else {
            prev.next = undefined;
            return [this.value, head];
        }
    }
    
    // recursive case
    else {
        // ?
    }
}
```

#### Finding the `prev` and `head` nodes

Our `removeLast(...)` base case requires a `head` node reference (the first node in the list),
and a `prev` node reference (the previous node in the list, relative to `this`).

There is a very simple solution: take `prev` and `head` as arguments to `removeLast(...)`:

```js
// Deletes the last node in this list.
//
// Returns [v, newHead] where v is the value that was removed, and
// newHead is the new head of the list (possibly undefined).
//
// Arguments:
//   prev is a reference to the previous node. If there is no previous node,
//   then set prev to undefined.
//   head is a reference to the first node in the list.
removeLast(prev, head) {
    ...
}
```

Client code must now invoke `removeLast` as follows:

```js
var [value, newHead] = head.removeLast(undefined, head);
```


### Use Tips 3 & 4: Make progress and assume correctness

We'll implement the recursive case by using Tips 3 & 4.

Here's the function we've developed so far:

```js
// Deletes the last node in this list.
//
// Returns [v, newHead] where v is the value that was removed, and
// newHead is the new head of the list (possibly undefined).
//
// Arguments:
//   prev is a reference to the previous node. If there is no previous node,
//   then set prev to undefined.
//   head is a reference to the first node in the list.
removeLast(prev, head) {
    // base case: if we've reached the end of the list
    if (this.next == undefined) {
        // ...
    }
    
    // recursive case
    else {
        // ?
    }
}
```

First, let's assume (Tip 4) that if we invoke `node.removeLast(prev, head)` it will work correctly; that is,
it will remove the last element in the list, and return `[v, newHead]`.

We make progress by invoking `removeLast(...)`  on `this.next`, i.e.:

```js
this.next.removeLast(prev, head)
```

But what is the value of `prev` for this invocation? Well, from the perspective of the `next` node, this node
is the `prev` node. Therefore, we set `prev` to `this`:

```js
this.next.removeLast(this, head)
```

Finally, we want to return `[v, head]`, which is actually what `this.next.removeLast(this, head)` returns.

Therefore simply: `return this.next.removeLast(this, head)` 

### Complete implementation of `removeLast(...)`

Our complete and final implemention of `removeLast` is as follows:

```js
class Node {

    ...

    // Deletes the last node in this list.
    //
    // Returns [v, newHead] where v is the value that was removed, and
    // newHead is the new head of the list (possibly undefined).
    //
    // Arguments:
    //   prev is a reference to the previous node. If there is no previous node,
    //   then set prev to undefined.
    //   head is a reference to the first node in the list.
    removeLast(prev = undefined, head = this) {
        
        if (this.next == undefined) {
            if (head == this) {
                return [this.value, undefined];
            } else {
                prev.next = undefined;
                return [this.value, head];
            }
        } else {
            return this.next.removeLast(this, head);
        }
    }
}
```

<br><br><br><br>

## <a name="lec7">Lecture 7. `removeValue(...)`</a>

Let's implement `removeValue(...)`.

```js
class Node {
 
    ...

    // Deletes the node with the specified value.
    // It is an error if value is not found in the list.
    //
    // Returns the head of the new list, possibly undefined
    removeValue(value) {
        // ?
    }
} 
```

Recall the two steps for developing a recursive function:

- Step 1. Base case
 - Analyze the corner cases
 - Merge cases
- Step 2. Recursive case:
 - Make one step of progress
 - Assume correctness

### Step 1. Base Case

There are two base cases for `removeValue(...)`:

1. When we have found the sought-after value
2. When we have reached the end of the list

Therefore the framework for our function is as follows:

```js
// Deletes the node with the specified value.
// It is an error if value is not found in the list.
//
// Returns the head of the new list, possibly undefined
removeValue(value) {

    // Base Case 1: When we have found the sought-after value
    if (this.value == value) {
        // ?
    }
    
    // Base Case 2: When we have reached the end of the list
    else if (this.next == undefined) {
        // ?
    }
    
    // Recursive case
    else {
        // ?
    }

}
```

For the second base case, we simply want to report an error message:

```js
// Deletes the node with the specified value.
// It is an error if value is not found in the list.
//
// Returns the head of the new list, possibly undefined
removeValue(value) {

    // Base Case 1: When we have found the sought-after value
    if (this.value == value) {
        // ?
    }
    
    // Base Case 2: When we have reached the end of the list
    else if (this.next == undefined) {
        console.error("The list did not contain the value we're looking for"); // <---------------
    }
    
    // Recursive case
    else {
        // ?
    }

}
```

The first base case requires more care. It is here we analyze the corner cases and seek opportunies to merge cases.

#### Analyze the corner cases

Recall the four corner cases:

- (A) `this` != first node AND `this` != last node
- (B) `this` != first node AND `this` == last node
- (C) `this` == first node AND `this` != last node
- (D) `this` == first node AND `this` == last node

##### Corner Case (A): `this` != first node AND `this` != last node

In this case, we know that the `this` node is sandwiched between two other nodes.

We want to find the previous node, say `prev`, and set `prev.next` to `this.next`, thereby
modifying the list so that `this` is skipped over.

Then we want to return the head of the list.

For this to work, we must have a reference to the previous node and the first node. We use the same approach from (Lecture 6)[#lec6], which is to add `prev` and `head` to the argument list:

```js
// Deletes the node with the specified value.
// It is an error if value is not found in the list.
//
// Returns the head of the new list, possibly undefined
//
// Arguments:
//   prev is a reference to the previous node. If there is no previous node,
//   then set prev to undefined.
//   head is a reference to the first node in the list.
removeValue(value, prev = undefined, head = this) { // <----------------------------------------

    // Base Case 1: When we have found the sought-after value
    if (this.value == value) {
        // ?
    }
    
    // Base Case 2: When we have reached the end of the list
    else if (this.next == undefined) {
        console.error("The list did not contain the value we're looking for");
    }
    
    // Recursive case
    else {
        // ?
    }

}
```

Then we can implement Corner Case (A):

```js
// Deletes the node with the specified value.
// It is an error if value is not found in the list.
//
// Returns the head of the new list, possibly undefined
//
// Arguments:
//   prev is a reference to the previous node. If there is no previous node,
//   then set prev to undefined.
//   head is a reference to the first node in the list.
removeValue(value, prev = undefined, head = this) {

    // Base Case 1: When we have found the sought-after value
    if (this.value == value) {
    
        // Corner Case (A)
        if (this != head && this.next != undefined) { // <-------------------------------
            prev.next = this.next;
            return head;
        }
        
        ...
    }
    
    // Base Case 2: When we have reached the end of the list
    else if (this.next == undefined) {
        console.error("The list did not contain the value we're looking for");
    }
    
    // Recursive case
    else {
        // ?
    }

}
```

##### Corner Case (B): `this` != first node AND `this` == last node

Here, we want to set `prev.next` equal to `undefined`.

Let's see if we can Merge Corner Case (A) with Corner Case (B), rather than implementing Corner Case (B) as a separate case.

Observe, `this.next == undefined`, since `this` is the last node.

Therefore, we can set `prev.next` equal to `this.next`, which is what we do in Corner Case (A).

Therefore, Corner Case (A) and (B) are equivalent cases, so we can Merge them.

We modify the conditional for Corner Case (A) to include Corner Case (B) as well:

```js
    // Base Case 1: When we have found the sought-after value
    if (this.value == value) {
        
        // Corner Case (A) and (B)
        if (this != head) { // <----------------------------------------------------
            prev.next = this.next;
            return head;
        }
        
        ...
    }
```

### Corner Case (C): `this` == first node AND `this` != last node

Here, we simply want to change the head of the list to `this.next`.

Let's see if we can Merge Corner Case (C) with (A) or (B), rather than implementing Corner Case (C) as a separate case.

Clearly, we can't make this Merge because (A) and (B) return `head` and it is impossible for `head` to be equal to `this.next`.

So, we implement (C) by defining an `else if` statement that returns `this.next`:

```js
    // Base Case 1: When we have found the sought-after value
    if (this.value == value) {
        
        // Corner Case (A) and (B)
        if (this != head) {
            prev.next = this.next;
            return head;
        }
        
        // Corner Case (C)
        else if (this.next != undefined) // <----------------------------------------------------
            return this.next
        }

        ...
    }
```

##### Corner Case (D): `this` == first node AND `this` == last node

In this case, `this` is the only node. Therefore, we want to return `undefined` which signifies an empty list.

Let's see if we can Merge Corner Case (C) and (D), rather than implementing Corner Case (D) as a separate case.

Observe, `this.next == undefined`, since `this` is the last node.

Therefore, we can Merge (C) and (D) by returning `this.next` to achieve the desired effect.

We modify the conditional for Corner Case (C) to include Corner Case (D). We simplify change the `else if` to an `else`:

```js
    // Base Case 1: When we have found the sought-after value
    if (this.value == value) {
        
        // Corner Case (A) and (B)
        if (this != head) {
            prev.next = this.next;
            return head;
        }
        
        // Corner Case (C) and (D)
        else { // <----------------------------------------------------
            return this.next
        }

        ...
    }
```
