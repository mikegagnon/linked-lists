## Lecture 1. Introduction

A linked list is a data structure that stores a list of values.

It's kind of like an array, except list operations have different performance characteristics compared to arrays.

For example:

- It takes a short amount of time to retrieve the *n*th element in an array
- It takes a longer amount of time to retrive the *n*th element in a list
