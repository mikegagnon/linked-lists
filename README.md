# Linked Lists
This document provides a mini course in linked lists in JavaScript.

A "linked list" is a data structure that stores a list of values.

It's kind of like an array, except list operations have different performance characteristics compared to arrays.

For example:

- In an array, it is quick to retrieve the *n*th element
- In a linked list, it is relatively slow to retrive the *n*th element 

## Prerequisites

Familiarity with JS, particularily object-oriented programming in JS. 

## Contents

## Lecture 1. Recursion

A linked list is a "recursive" data structure, and uses "recursive" algorithms.

Recursion essentially means self referential.

So, a recursive data structure refers to itself, and a recursive algorithm refers to itself.

The above gibberish will make sense once we start programming recursive data structures and algorithms.
